# Colin's Full stack rust application

To run this application you need to start the front and backend seperately. To do this you can run the following commands:

-Backend: `<cargo +nightly run -p backend --bin backend>`\
    -This needs to be executed from the root directory\
-Frontend: In terminal run `<microserver>`\
    -This needs to be execute from the `</fullstack/frontend>` directory


To create a new task:
`<cargo +nightly run -p backend --bin todo new '<task_here>'>`
